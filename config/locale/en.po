"language: without filtering, if an entity has three translations it "
"will add three rows to the results; if you filter by language, at most "
"one result will appear (it could be zero if that particular entity "
"does not have a translation matching your language filter choice). If "
"a view uses relationships, each entity in the relationship needs to be "
"filtered separately. You can filter a view to a fixed language choice, "
"such as English or Spanish, or to the language selected by the page "
"the view is displayed on (the language that is selected for the page "
"by the language detection settings either for Content or User "
"interface)."
msgstr ""
msgid ""
"Because each result row contains a specific translation of each "
"entity, field-level filters are also relative to these entity "
"translations. For example, if your view has a filter that specifies "
"that the entity title should contain a particular English word, you "
"will presumably filter out all rows containing Chinese translations, "
"since they will not contain the English word. If your view also has a "
"second filter specifying that the title should contain a particular "
"Chinese word, and if you are using \"And\" logic for filtering, you "

"Independent of filtering, you can choose the display language (the "

"view row\" and \"Original language of content in view row\", which "
"means to display each entity in the result row using the language that "
"entity has or in which it was originally created. In theory, this "
"would give you the flexibility to filter to French translations, for "
"instance, and then display the results in Spanish. The more usual "
"choices would be to use the same language choices for the display "
"language and each entity filter in the view, or to use the Row "
